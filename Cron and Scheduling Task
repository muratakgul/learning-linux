The "cron" service allows us to schedule commands to run at regular intervals like:
-Every 30 minutes
-Every day at midnight
-Every 1st of the month
-Every December 15th

Editing the crontab
To set up a cron job, we need to edit the crontab configuration file.
Rather than edit the files directly, it is better to use the "crontab -e" commands

Place: /var/spool/cron/crontab

crontab -e --> will open with text editor and we can write our job at the end of file and save it.

Cron Syntax:

	a		 b		 c		 d		 e		 command
  Minute	Hour	Day		Month	Day(of the week)
   0-59		0-23	1-31	1-12	0-6

* * * * * command	--> Run a job every minute 
30 * * * * command	--> Run a job every 30 minute
0  0 * * * command	--> Run a job every day at midnight
30 6 * * * command	--> Run a job everyday at 6:30 AM
30 18* * * command	--> Run a job everyday at 6:30 PM
30 6 * * 1 command	--> Run a job every Monday at 6:30 AM
30 6 * 4 1 command	--> Run a job every Monday in April at 6:30 AM
0  0 1 * * command	--> Run a job at midnight on the first of every month

CRONTAB GURU website will help you to make some practise on cron time

crontab -e -->  enter and type in crontab file below commands at the end of the file:
 * * * * * echo "Another Minute! Date is: $(date)" >> ~/time.log	--> Runs this command every minute
20 * * * * echo "It is 20 minutes past the hour!" >> ~/time.log	--> Runs this command every hour past 20 min.

Handling Errors in a Cron Job:
Our cron job is not working fine, we may probably see no error, nothing!
If we have a complex cron job and we are not sure it is running correctly, we can send standart error(2) such as below:
 * * * * * ecsdfho "Another Minute! Date is: $(date)" >> ~/time.log 2>&1 -->standard output and standard error will be sent to the same file.


Schedule a backup task for every morning (Will backup all Desktop items)
mkdir backups --> create a directory called backups under home directory
nano my-backup --> create a file under backups directory called my-backup and type in there below script and then save it.
	#!/bin/bash
	DATE=$(date +%m-%d-%Y)
	BACKUP_DIR="/home/makgul/backups"
	
	tar -cvzf $BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE.tar.gz /home/makgul/Desktop
	
Make it this file executable:
	chmod +x my-backup

Type "my-backup" and see the backup is created under /home/makgul/backups folder with the name of "backup-08-09-2022.tar.gz"

In order to schedule it with cron:
crontab -e --> enter and add below command at the end of file and save it.
