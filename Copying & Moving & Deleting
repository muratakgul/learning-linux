## The cp command (copying)
  cp file1 file2 --> copying file1 to file2 in the current directory
  cp file1 dir1/file2 --> copying file1 to dir1 as another name (file2)
  cp -i file1 file2 --> copying a file prompting the user if it overwrites the destination
  cp -p file1 file2 --> preserving the file permissions, group and ownership when copying
  cp -v file1 file2 --> being verbose
  cp -r dir1 dir2/ --> recursively copying dir1 to dir2 in the current directory
  cp -r file1 file2 dir1 dir2 destination_directory/  --> copy more source files and directories to a destination directory

## The mv command (moving, renaming)
  mv file1 file2 --> renaming file1 to file2
  mv file1 dir1/ --> moving file1 to dir1
  mv -i file1 dir1/ -->  moving a file prompting the user if it overwrites the destination file
  mv -n file1 dir1/ --> preventing a existing file from being overwritten
  mv -u file1 dir1/  --> moving only if the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing
  mv file1 dir1/file2 --> moving file1 to dir1 as file2
  mv file1 file2 dir1/ dir2/ destination_directory/ --> moving more source files and directories to a destination directory
  mv file1 file2 file3 file4 /dir5 --> moving 4 files into a directory
  mv file1 and dir1/ ~ --> moving file1 and dir1 into my home directory
 
## The rm command (removing, deleting)
Before using rm command always test with echo to see what will you delete
It is also better to use -i option for prompting one by one what will be deleted if you are not sure what is in a directory
  rm file1 --> removing a file
  rm -v file1 --> being verbose when removing a file
  rm dir1 --> does not delete, it requires -d or -r option
  rm -r dir2/ --> removing a directory
  rm -rf dir3/ --> removing a directory without prompting
  rm -ri file1 dir4/ --> removing a file and a directory prompting the user for confirmation
  shred -vu -n 100 file1 --> secure removal of a file (verbose with 100 rounds of overwriting)
  rm -d dir5 --> remove it if it is empty
