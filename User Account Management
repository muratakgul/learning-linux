User Account Management:
	useradd
	userdel
	groupadd
	groupdel
	usermod

All info about users are the following files:
	/etc/passwd = users and info: username:x:uid:gid:comment:home_directory:login_shell
	/etc/shadow = This file contains encrypted user password and password policy
	/etc/group = All group and user group information
	etc/gshadow = Group information with passwords
	etc/login.defs = default options for the new user

 
useradd OPTIONS:
	-m --> create home directory
	-d directory --> specify another home directory
	-c --> "comment"
	-s --> shell
	-G --> specify the secondary groups (must exist)
	-g --> specify the primary group (must exist)

Exemple:
	useradd -m -d /home/john -c "C++ Developer" -s /bin/bash -G sudo,adm,mail john


changing a user account
usermod OPTIONS --> uses the same options as useradd

Example:
	usermod -aG developers,managers john --> adding the user to two secondary groups


deleting a user account
	userdel -r username --> -r removes user's home directory as well (may not delete user's groups, consider deluser command and try)


groupmod -n engineers engineering  --> to change the group name from engineering to engineers - renaming the group

displaying all groups
	cat /etc/groups

displaying the groups a user belongs to
	groups

creating admin users
	add the user to sudo group in Ubuntu and wheel group in CentOS
	usermod -aG sudo john
 
id user1 -> get the user info

in cd /home list the users with ls command

grep user1 /etc/group -- we can display only user1 with grep command

useradd -e 2022-12-31 user2 --> expiration date for user wit -e option -- (for temporary users)
chage -l user1 -->  for the account and expiration policy information
	-L lock the user account
	-U unlock the user account

If we see /nologon or in/false at the end of lines in etc/passwd file, they are probably service or system accounts and they will not be able to login to the system

passwd user1 --> to create a password or change the existing password

useradd -G wheel user1 -- Wheel grubu üyesi değilse bu şekilde üye yapabiliriz. -aG mi yoksa -G yeterli mi bak
sudo file can be modified with "visudo". We can add normal user under root but it is not recommended!!

file  ./etc/sudoers ??

groups -- displays the current user's groups that he or she member of
groups root -- displays root's groups
groups user1 -- displays user1's groups
id -- displays current users id and primary group id and secondary groups that he or she member of
