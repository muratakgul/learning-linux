## Linux File types (7 file types exist)

ls -F (F shows file type with icons and understand all file types like named pipes, socket etc.) 

- regular file
d directory
l link
c special file or device file
s socket
p Named pipe
b block device

 
## Reserved Filenames:
    /    - the root directory (slash)
     .   - current directory (period)
     ..  - parent directory (double period)
     ~  - your home directory (tilde)

## Extensions: may be used to identify types of files
     libc.a              - Archive, library file
     program.c       - C language source file
     alpha2.f          - Fortran source file
     xwd2ps.o       - Object/executable code
     mygames.Z    - Compressed file

## Hidden Files: have names that begin with a dot (.) For example:
     .cshrc      .login      .mailrc     .mwmrc  

ls -F     --> Displays file types at the end of the file
/           --> Finish with / and blue, it is a directory
If it is black font e.g linux.txt, it is a normal file
@        --> Finish with @ and light blue, it is a sym link
=         --> Finish with =, it is a socket
Pipe |  --> Finish with |, it is a named pipe
char device --> yellow with black background

file /run/* --> Displays all file types under that specific directory
file /etc --> Displays that is the directory
file /etc/passwd --> Displays that is norma file (ASCII Text)

File name length: can be up to 256 characters
File and directory names are case sensitive. File1 and file1 is not the same!

## Linux Paths
.        => the current working directory
..       => the parent directory
~       => the user's home directory

cd      => changing the current directory to user's home directory
cd ~   => changing the current directory to user's home directory
cd -    => changing the current directory to the last directory
cd /path_to_dir    => changing the current directory to path_to_dir
pwd   => printing the current working directory

cd
Go to current user's directory from anywhere you are
cd /
Go to root directory
cd ~
Go to your home directory
cd ..
 Go to previous directory

## Installing tree
sudo apt install tree
tree directory/   => Ex: tree .
tree -d .             => prints only directories
tree -f .             => prints absolute paths

## Absolute and Relative Path
cd /var/log -- absolute path to directory (Provide exact path from the root / )
cd /var
cd log -- relative path (just type the name of the file or directory under spesific directory)
