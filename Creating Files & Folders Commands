touch file1--> create a new file called file1
touch file2 file3 --> create two files at the same time
touch ../file4 --> create file4 file one level back up directory
touch ~/file5 --> create file5 under current user's home directory

touch (in man page) --> change file timestamps (update the access and modification times of each file)
touch file.txt --> creating an empty file if it does not exist, update the timestamps if the file exists
touch -a file --> changing only the access time to current time (because access time metadata is changed, change time will change too)
touch -m file --> changing only the modification time to current time
touch -m -t 201812301530.45 a.txt --> changing the modification time to a specific date and time
touch -d "2010-10-31 15:45:30" a.txt -->  changing both atime and mtime to a specific date and time
touch a.txt -r b.txt --> changing the timestamp of a.txt to those of b.txt

touch {a..f} dene


file cheatsheet --> pdf
file abc.jpg --> jpeg
file file6 --> if result empty that means it is a normal file
if we change the jpg to txt in GUI, it still shows the metadata as jpeg in CLI
When we create an empty file, write html tags/codes in it and save it. When you type "file" command with file name, it will display it as html file instead of normal file

mkdir dir3 --> create directory called dir3
mkdir first/second/third gives error, we should use --parent (-p) option to create nested directories
mkdir -p mydir1/mydir2/mydir3 --> creating a directory and its parents as well
mkdir dir{1..7} --> create seven directories named dir1 to dir7
