## File system hiararchy:

1. / – Root
⦁ Every single file and directory starts from the root directory.
⦁ Only root user has write privilege under this directory.
⦁ Please note that /root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /.

2. /bin – User Binaries
⦁ Contains binary executables.
⦁ Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
⦁ Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.
⦁ For example: ps, ls, ping, grep, cp.

3. /sbin – System Binaries
⦁ Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
⦁ But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose.
⦁ For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

4. /etc – Configuration Files
⦁ Contains configuration files required by all programs.
⦁ This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
⦁ For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf

5. /dev – Device Files
⦁ Contains device files.
⦁ These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
⦁ For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

6. /proc – Process Information
⦁ Contains information about system process.
⦁ This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
⦁ This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

7. /var – Variable Files
⦁ var stands for variable files.
⦁ Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory.
⦁ This includes — system log files (/var/log); packages and database files (/var/lib); emails (/var/mail); print queues (/var/spool); lock files (/var/lock); temp files needed across reboots (/var/tmp);

8. /tmp – Temporary Files
⦁ Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
⦁ Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

9. /usr – User Programs
⦁ Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
⦁ /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
⦁ /usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
⦁ /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
⦁ /usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2

10. /home – Home Directories
⦁ Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
⦁ For example: /home/john, /home/nikita

11. /boot – Boot Loader Files
⦁ Contains boot loader related files.
⦁ Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
⦁ For example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

12. /lib – System Libraries
⦁ Contains library files that supports the binaries located under /bin and /sbin
⦁ Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
⦁ For example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

13. /opt – Optional add-on Applications
⦁ opt stands for optional.
⦁ Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
⦁ add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

14. /mnt – Mount Directory
⦁ Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

15. /media – Removable Media Devices
⦁ Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
⦁ For examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer

16. /srv – Service Data
⦁ srv stands for service.
⦁ Contains server specific services related data.
⦁ For example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/bin --- essential user command binaries - contains binaries or user executable files which are available to all users.

/boot --- static files of the boot loader - contains files required for starting your system.

/dev --- device files (USB or any  other device attach to the system, when you attach any device then your system will create its device file inside this location, so then you access your device)

/etc --- host specific system configuration - contains most, if not all system-wide configuration files

/home --- users' home directories

/lib --- shared libraries - conrains shared library files used by different applications.

/media --- removable media (cdrom, cd recorder, floppy...) - is used for external storage will be automatically mounted.

/mnt --- mounted filesystem (old, floppy vs...) - is like /media but it's not very often used these days

/opt --- add-on application software package

/sbin --- system binaries - contains applications that only the superuser will need.

/srv --- data for service from system

/tmp --- temporary files for system and user as well - contains temporary files, usually saved there by applications that are running. Non-privileged users may also store files here temporarily.

/usr --- user utilities and applications (majority of multiuser applications, it also keeps binaries libraries, documentation and source code for the programs) -- contains many other subdirectories binaries files, shared libraries and so on. On some ditros like CentOS many commands are saved in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin instead of /bin and /sbin.

/proc --- process information (after restart it will gone and re-created after reboot with fress process info.) - is a virtual directory. It contains information about your computer hardware, such as information about your CPU, RAM memory or kernel. The files and directories are generated when your computer starts or on the fly, as your system is running and things change. /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo

/sys --- contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.

/run --- is a temporary file system which runs in RAM

/var --- typically contains variable-length files such as logs which are files that register events that happen on the system.
