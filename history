cat .bash_history

history --> showing the history
History -c --> removing the entire history

Echo $HISTSIZE --> printing the no. of history commands saved in the memory
echo $HISTFILESIZE --> printing the no. of commands saved in the history file (~/.bash_history)

!! --> rerunning the last command from the history
!20 --> unning  a specific command from the history (ex: the 20th command)
!-10 --> running the last nth (10th) command from the history

 
If you do not want your command that you typed displayed in history do the following:

HISTCONTROL is set ignoreboth or ignorespace, not ignoredups
Echo $HISTCONTROL --> You can check how is set it up
HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth or
echo "HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth"  >> .bashrc --> Allows you to write this in .basrc to be persistent. (even machine restarted, it will still applied.)
And then type the command giving one space --> it will not diplayed in history.
