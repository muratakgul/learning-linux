## Running commands as root (sudo, su)


running a command as root (only users that belong to sudo group [Ubuntu] or wheel [CentOS])
	sudo command --> do it with root rights and exit right away
	sudo su 	 --> Permanently enter root user with normal user's home directory
	Exit 	   	 --> Exit from the root user to normal user
	su - 		 --> switch user to root user and enter the root password
	

sudo examples:
	Sudo adduser user1 -- Add new user
	Sudo userdel user1 -- remove user, but not delete user files
	Sudo userdel -r user1 -- remove user with it's all files
	Su user1 -c "ls" -- Run ls command in user1 home directory
	sudo passwd root	 --> setting the root password
	Sudo passwd username --> changing a user's password


sudo cat /etc/passwd --> show all users and user information
Sudo cat /etc/shadow -- show all users and their encrypted passwords
Sudo usermod -L user2 -- Lock user2, then user cannot enter or use its account
Sudo usermod -U user2 -- Unlock user2
 
Sudo groupadd group1 --> create new group
Sudo usermod -G group1 user1 --> add user to group
sudo cat /etc/group --> Check groups and information
Sudo groupmod -n group2 group1 -- Change group name from group1 to group2
Sudo groupdel group1 -- delete group

If you enter root password with "sudo su" it keeps 5 minutes in the cache and you will be not asked for the password during this time and you can do administrative tasks
We can extend 5 minutes time with "sudo -v" command
If we do not want to remember password we can use "sufo -k" command, it will ask password immediately after this command if we try to do administrative task with sudo
